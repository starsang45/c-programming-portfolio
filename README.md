# C Programming Projects

This repository contains various C programming projects focused on:
- Sorting Algorithm Visualizer
- Dynamic Memory User Data Management
- Membership Information System

## Features

### 1. Sorting Algorithms
- Implements various sorting techniques:
  - Sequential Sort
  - Selection Sort
  - Bubble Sort
  - Insertion Sort
  - Quick Sort
- Provides step-by-step outputs for educational purposes.
- User selects the desired sorting algorithm via a menu-driven interface.

### 2. Dynamic Memory Allocation
- Demonstrates dynamic memory allocation using `malloc`.
- Collects user inputs for arrays of integers.
- Frees allocated memory properly to prevent memory leaks.

### 3. Structure-Based User Data Management
- Utilizes `struct` to define a user data structure (ID, level, name).
- Dynamically allocates memory for an array of user structures.
- Inputs and displays user details efficiently.
